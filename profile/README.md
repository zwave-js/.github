<p align="center"><b>The home for Z-Wave related libraries and apps based on Z-Wave JS</b></p>

Built on Node.js and compatible with all known 500, 700 and 800 series Z-Wave controller hardware adapters, the **Z-Wave JS** driver runs on almost anything with a little bit of computing power and a serial port.

Started in 2018, Z-Wave JS has breathed new life into the Z-Wave ecosystem and now powers thousands of smart homes and some of the largest home automation systems all over the world.

### About us
